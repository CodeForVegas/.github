# This Organization is Depracated

The original *Code for Vegas* brigade org transitioned to the *Code for Vegas Foundation* org here on GitHub. With the change of name of the Foundation to *Innovate for Vegas Foundation* the original GitHub org has been re-named, and this org exists moving forward to catch legacy references and searches and hopefully direct people to the right place.

[New Innovate for Vegas Foundation org](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas)

## Updating your local trees

If you had cloned or forked or otherwise maintained a local copy of a CodeForVegas repo, please visit the .git/config file and change *CodeForVegas* to *InnovateForVegas*.

Alternately, you can use the git cli in your repository directory:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/new-repository.git
```

Where *new-repoistory.git* is the actual name of the remote repository in question.

## Legacy Projects

There are legacy project repositories in the new InnovateForVegas org which are largely unmaintained, they may be relocated to this org as part of the maintainance of legacy.

## Name Transition Elsewhere

There may be references to *Code for Vegas Foundation* in various places, including State and Federal documentation, during the legal name-change process. Other than this legacy org here on GitHub, all references to *Code for Vegas Foundation* are references to *Innovate for Vegas Foundation*.
